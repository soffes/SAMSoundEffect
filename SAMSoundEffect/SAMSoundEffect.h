/**
 This class simplifies playing sound effects as well as implementing basic caching behavior. It retains an
 `AVAudioPlayer` object with it's sound effect pre-cached and ready to play instantly. It is designed to provide user
 interface audio feedback, making it optimal for playing short sound clips.

 There can be some loading time between when a sound effect is initialized and when it is ready for playback. For this
 reason it is recommended to preload the sound in advance of when it is needed (for low latency playback). When you
 should preload is left up to your implementation, however a convenience method (`preloadSoundEffectNamed:`) is
 provided.

 resulting sound effect object. This provides performance benefits and simpler syntax as well as assuring the sound
